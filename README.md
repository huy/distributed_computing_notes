One of concern of distributed computing is how to reach an agreement among N parties also refer to as distributed concensus. Parties comunicate with each other asynchronously using no reliable network in which message can be lost, duplicated, reordered.

Algorithm solving distributed consensus relies on quorums to make decisions.
