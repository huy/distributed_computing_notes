## Distributed computing

One of concern of distributed computing is how to reach an agreement among N parties also refer to as distributed concensus. Parties comunicate with each other asynchronously using non reliable network in which message can be lost, duplicated, reordered.
In extreme, a party may pass a false message to other either intentionaly or accidently, an phenomena described as byzantine problem.

Algorithm solving distributed consensus relies on quorums to make decisions.
